# How to run

To Install Dependencies:

Run

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then, you'll need to launch the Flask script:

Run

```
python -m flask --app homepage run
```

Now the output should provide you with a link to open on your browser.

It is usually "http://127.0.0.1:5000"

Opening that link once you see the Flask script running and you should be able to view that page!
